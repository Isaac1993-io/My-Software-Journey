    <h2>A step-by-step walk through of your first HTML page</h2>

    <img src="../HTML projects/static images/0000000000001491.png" />

    <p>
      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create
      and design web pages. It provides the structure for web content, defining
      elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, and forms.
      HTML is the foundation of web development, working alongside CSS
      (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. "
    </p>

    <p>
      However simple this might seem, it is a mighty useful tool when it comes
      to full-fledged web development. Various tools easily eliminate the HTML
      coding from your work process- but if you want to be infull control of
      your web-page, you'll need to have some command over HTML. <br />

      through this article, we ai, to give you the essential HTML building
      blocks that'll help you get up and running. Reading this you'll be able to
      understand an HTML source code and even modifyif for your own good!
    </p>

    <h3>Step One - TAGS</h3>
    <img src="../HTML projects/static images/Bracket485.png" alt="Bracket" />

    <p>
      Tags are what you'll see the most when you look at any HTML source code. A
      tag can ideally be seen as a wrapper to any item on your HTML document.
      Tags tell what magic is to be done on the content enclosed by them.
    </p>
    <p>Lets look at two type of tags.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        &lt; tag-example-1 &gt; I need a closing tag &lt; tag-example-1 &gt;
      </li>
      <li>&lt; tag-example-2 &gt; i don't need a closing tag</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      In the first example, the sentence is wrapped by two tags. the first one
      is called the opening tag and the second one is called the closing tag.
      Everything is between is affected by the properties of the tag. Very
      commonly used examples of such tags are &lt;html &gt; , &lt;head &gt;
      ,&lt;body &gt;, &lt;strong &gt; , etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second example tags about loner tags- as in, they don't need a closing
      tag to function. although it's not required, these type of tags are often
      written as &lt;tag/ &gt; to maje the debugging of code easier. Common
      examples of such tags are &lt; hr/&gt; - used for horizontal line, &lt;
      br/&gt;- to break the line, etc.
    </p>

    <h3>step Two- HTML,HEAD,and BODY: The three pillars of your document</h3>
    <img src="../HTML projects/static images/0000000000001488.jpg" alt="" />

    <p>
      These tags are essential for any HTML document. They parcel out the
      significant parts of your HTML code.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        &lt;BODY &gt; &lt;/BODY &gt; is placed below the your &lt;HEAD &gt; tag,
        and everything taht you want to be desplayed on your screen comes under
        this tag. Text, images,links and pretty much anything you can see in
        your browser live inside this tag.
      </li>
      <li>
        &lt;HTML &gt; &lt;/HTML &gt; wraps yuor entire code. everything else in
        your HTML document needs to come inside these tags
      </li>
      <li>
        &lt;HEAD &gt; &lt;/HEAD &gt; includes things like title, styles and
        script. Head is usaully present at the top (hah!), Just inside the
        &gt;/HTML&lt;tag.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step three- A few tags that'll make your page pretty</h3>

    <p>
      Now that you know how to setup the skeleton of your document, let's
      proceed with the things that will go inside your &gt;BODY &lt;tag and do
      some magic!
    </p>

    <p>Some basics text formatting tags:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&lt; b&gt; &lt; /b &gt; makes your text looks <b>bold</b></li>
      <li>&lt; i&gt; &lt; /i &gt; makes you write in <i>cursive</i></li>
      <li>&lt; u&gt; &lt; /u &gt; <u>underlines what you wrote</u></li>
    </ul>

    <p>For,example, this piece of code</p>

    <div
      style="border-bottom: 1px solid black; width: 100%; margin: 20px 0"
    ></div>
    &lt;html&gt;<br />

    <br />
    &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;<br />

    &lt;body&gt;<br />

    <br />

    &lt;i&gt; I am Italic! &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br/&gt; <br />
    <br />
    &lt;;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt; I am bold! &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt; <br />
    <br />
    &lt;u&gt; And me,well, I'm underlined! &lt;/u&gt; &lt;br/&gt;<br />
    <br />
    &lt;/body&gt;<br />
    <br />
    &lt;/html&gt;

    <div
      style="border-bottom: 1px solid black; width: 100%; margin: 20px 0"
    ></div>

    <p>
      Should produce something like this on your browser: Don't fret too much
      about the &lt;br/&gt;. it's just for breaking the line so that you can
      start from the next line.Enter key does little when it comes to changing
      lines in yuor HTML document.
    </p>

    />

    <h4>Tags to help you structure your content</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>
        &lt;br/ &gt; breaks the line,making you continue to the next line.
      </li>
      <li>
        &lt;p &gt; stands for paragrap. it divides your content into paragraphs
      </li>
    </ul>

    <i
      >Note: you need to use this tags as space and enter keys do very little
      when it comes to formatting content inside an HTML document</i
    >

    <h4>Headings Tags:</h4>

    <p>
      HTML provides you with six tags, from &lt;H1&gt; &lt;/H1&gt; to &lt;H6&gt;
      &lt;H6/&gt; to help you create different sized headers quickly
    </p>

    <img
      src="../HTML projects/static images/0000000000001487.png"
      alt="_blank"
    />

    <h4>Inserting an image:</h4>

    <p>
      All that's good, but what fun without images on the webpage? Don't worry,
      &lt; IMG/ &gt; to the rescue! The image tag has a mandatory attribute
      called "source". Basically, it tells the browser where it should look for
      the image. The syntax goes something like:
    </p>

    <i> &lt; img src="path_to_your_image"/</i>

    <p>
      Furthermore, it also has attributes like height and width that let you
      specify the height and width you want your image to take.
    </p>

    <h4>Lists:</h4>
    <p>
      HTML hastwo types of lists- ordered and unordered. Each item of your list
      has to be enclosed in a tag. the syntax for creating a list is fairly
      simple.
    </p>
    <p>Suppose you want to create a list like:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>item 1</li>
      <li>item 2</li>
      <li>item 3</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following code will easily do the job for you:</p>

    <div
      style="border-bottom: 1px solid black; width: 100%; margin: 20px 0"
    ></div>

    &lt;ul &gt; &lt;li &gt; item 1 &lt;/li &gt; &lt;li &gt; item 2 &lt;/li &gt;
    &lt;li &gt; item 3 &lt;/li &gt; &lt;/ul &gt;

    <div
      style="border-bottom: 1px solid black; width: 100%; margin: 20px 0"
    ></div>

    <p>
      This, by the way, was an example of an unordered list: For an ordered
      list, all you need to do is replace &lt; ul &gt; with &lt; ol &gt; and
      &lt; /ul &gt; &lt; /ol &gt;.
    </p>

    <p>Let's see what the following code does:</p>

    <div
      style="border-bottom: 1px solid black; width: 100%; margin: 20px 0"
    ></div>

    &lt;html&gt; <br />
    <br />
    &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; <br />
    <br />
    &lt;body &gt; <br />
    <br />
    &lt;ul&gt; <br />
    <br />
    &lt;li&gt; I a m unordered list's item 1! &lt;/li&gt; <br />
    &lt;li&gt; I a m unordered list's item 2! &lt;/li&gt; <br />
    &lt;li&gt; I a m unordered list's item 3! &lt;/li&gt; <br />
    &lt;li&gt; I a m unordered list's item 4! &lt;/li&gt; <br />
    <br />
    &lt;/ul&gt; <br />
    <br />

    &lt;ol&gt; <br />
    <br />
    &lt;li&gt; I a m ordered list's item 1! &lt;/li&gt; <br />
    &lt;li&gt; I a m ordered list's item 2! &lt;/li&gt; <br />
    &lt;li&gt; I a m ordered list's item 3! &lt;/li&gt; <br />
    &lt;li&gt; I a m ordered list's item 4! &lt;/li&gt; <br />
    <br />
    &lt;/ol&gt; <br />
    <br />

    &lt;/body&gt;<br />
    <br />
    &lt;html&gt;

    <div
      style="border-bottom: 1px solid black; width: 100%; margin: 20px 0"
    ></div>
    <br />
    <div
      style="border-bottom: 1px solid black; width: 100%; margin: 20px 0"
    ></div>

    <img
      src="../HTML projects/static images/0000000000001489.png"
      alt="_blank"
    />
    <br />

    <p>
      All of these tags, when arranged coherently, will provide you with a
      simple webpage consisting of images, heading, and lists. Further, there
      are various tags that HTML supports, and we thoroughly recommend you to
      check them out and play with them!

      You know enough of skim through and understand any part of an HTML code.
      We request you to go ahead and try skimming through the source code of any
      website(you'll find some tags you don't know, but that's how you learn!)
